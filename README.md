# Cloudflare Minecraft Avatar API

I used Cloudflare Workers, Hono, and Photon (CF WASM) to quickly put together a API to crop skin and cape textures.

It is pretty easy to edit and run yourself.

I am also hosting it on my own Cloudflare https://cf-minecraft-avatar-api.faav.workers.dev/ (You can see the documentation here)
